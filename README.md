Creating a basic landing page using HTML and CSS skills.

## Description

This is a project to create a basic landing page from scratch using pure HTML and CSS. This project helped me get a better understanding when it comes to position and displaying each element within the web page, which is a crucial skill to learn and build from. It was hard organizing all the different classes and IDs that were used for position each detail. I look forward learning new ways that can cut time in half when positioning and styling elements within a web page.
